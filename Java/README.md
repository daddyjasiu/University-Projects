# Programs coded in Java.

Mainly these are programs that use specific algorithms to solve some problems such as finding the shortest path or sorting.

Please note, that most of the programs have **Polish words in output or in variables' names**. For every program folder I have added a short description in English, so that non-Polish speakers could understand.

However, for Polish speakers every program folder contains a `pdf file` that is a original task written in Polish.
