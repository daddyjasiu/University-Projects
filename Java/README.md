# Programs coded in Java.

Mainly these are programs that use specific algorithms to solve some problems such as finding the shortest path or sorting.

Every `time complexity` or `space complexity` that I give is a **pessimistic, worst case complexity**. On average, while given proper, standard data, my algorithms might run **much faster** and need **much less** space than I have written.  

Please also note, that most of the programs have **Polish words in output or in variables' names**. For every program folder I have added a short description in English, so that non-Polish speakers could understand. 

However, for Polish speakers every program folder contains a `pdf file` that is a original task written in Polish.
