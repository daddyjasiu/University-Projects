# Finding the max sum of elements in 2D array.

For non-empty array find its maximum subarray containing the **largest, non-negative sum** having the time complexity no bigger than O(n<sup>3</sup>).
 
If every element of given input array is **negative**, then the array is **_"empty"_**.

First input variable is **how many sets of data will user want to type in**. Next two variables are respectively numbers of **rows** and **columns**. Indexes of the found sum have to be lexicographically the smallest.

The program outputs **`max_sum = <sum>,a[first_row...first_column][last_row...last_column]`**.
