# University-projects

### Hello world!

This repository is a warehouse of all of my **Jagiellonian University** work so far. New content will be added as I progress and dash through next years of education. All programs were coded by **me**.

Note, that in all of my **Java** programs I **mustn't** have used any import file other than **_`java.util.Scanner`_**.

In **C++** in most of my programs I could **only** enable **_`<iostream>`_** header file.
  
These were the **requirements** of submissions of the code at my university.
