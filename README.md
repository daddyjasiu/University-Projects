# University projects.

### Hello world!

This repository is a warehouse of all of my **algorithmic** work so far. New content will be added as I progress and dash through next years of education at **Jagiellonian University**. All programs were coded by **me**.

Note, that in all of my **Java** programs I didn't use
any import file other than **_`java.util.Scanner`_**.

In **C++** in most of my programs I am **only** enabling **_`<iostream>`_** header file.

This way all of my programs are *lightweight* and some parts of code can be written by using more imported libraries and header files.
