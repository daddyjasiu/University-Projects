### C++ program that performs certain operations on **strings** that are sentences.

Operations performed are: `formatting (adding other chars), normalizing (deletion of unnecessary signs, spaces
and chars), deletion of a word, returning the biggest word in a sentence`. All of these are coded
without the usage of `<string>` library.
