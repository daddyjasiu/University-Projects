# Continued operations using functions and procedures, but without using arrays this time.

Program allows us to `Sum` and `Multiply` `n` numbers of ANY length.

For example, you can add and multiply `-123456789123456789123456789` and `+00000012317826312837612837612837612837621387612383` without any problems!
