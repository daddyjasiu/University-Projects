### C++ program that performs operations on a data cube (3D array) with other 3D structures inside.

Cube operations are: `intersection of a data cube with the internal cuboid`, 
`intersection of a data cube with the internal tetrahedron`, 
`intersection of a data cube with the internal octal (1/4th of a ball)`, `determinant of a section of a data cube`.
