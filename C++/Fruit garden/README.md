# `Storehouse-like` program that uses `nested classes` to handle a fruit garden.

Garden consists of `trees` having `branches` having `fruits` that `weigh` a certain amount. Garden `lives` and its plants `grow over time`
increasing number of branches on trees, fruits on branches and weight of fruits. Fruits can be `plucked`, branches can be `shortened` and trees
can be `cut`. They can also be `planted` and if done so, they get `unique pointer` to them.
